		<p style="text-align:center"> Alexandria Habiby, known as Lexie, is a part-time petite commercial model for Colours Agency in Glasgow.  
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center"> Scouted in 2011, she beat over 2000 entrants to become one of the “Final 5” in the #ScoutMeScotland campaign to find Scotland’s next supermodel. Predominantly working in make up since then while enjoying the occasional fashion and editorial opportunities, she has to date worked with many of Scotland’s best make-up artists and photographers, such as Sara Hill and Donna McGowan respectively.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center">	Based in Aberdeen, she is able to travel all across Britain and abroad. Her versatile features lend her face to a multitude of styles from minimalistic to full glam and with a background in amateur theatre she is capable of adapting to the emotion that needs to be captured in the images.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center">A bright and sweet look is accompanied by a chatty and friendly presence; she has been praised by employers for her professionalism and communication skills. Getting to know people on set and making sure everyone is having a good day is almost as important as getting the job done to her.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center">Also a medical student at Aberdeen University, Alexandria spends her free time hanging out with friends and enjoys going to the beach and travelling.
